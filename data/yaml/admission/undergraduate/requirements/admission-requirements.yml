    <h2>After Applying</h2><p>Transfer credits are assessed upon admission and are typically outlined in an offer of admission.</p><p>Normally, applicants will be eligible to receive transfer credit for each successfully completed degree-level course. A maximum of 10.0 credits (2 years) can be transferred from a previously completed degree program.</p><p><strong>To view external courses that have previously been reviewed and approved for transfer credit, please view&nbsp;<a href="https://admission.uoguelph.ca/course-equivalencies-university">Course Equivalencies</a>.</strong></p><p>There are two student-types of&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;credit: specified and generic. A specified credit is granted when a course you’ve taken at another post-secondary institution is comparable or equivalent to a course that we offer at the University of Guelph. A generic credit is granted when you''re eligible for degree-level credit, but the content of the course you’ve taken doesn''t align with a University of Guelph course. Generic&nbsp;credits&nbsp;are electives and may or may not count towards the graduation requirements for the degree program you’re entering.&nbsp;</p><p>To help you understand your&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;credit assessment, it’s important to know what course numbers mean and where to find course contents. Each course is identified by a two-part code. The first part of the code refers to the subject area, the second to the level of the course. Courses in the 1000 series are mainly for first year students, those in the 2000 series are mainly for second year students, and those in the 3000 series are for third year students. Course contents can be found in the Undergraduate Calendar.&nbsp;</p><p>Course numbers beginning with 9 (e.g. PSYC*9110, ENGL*9210) are generic&nbsp;credits. To understand exactly how your&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;credits&nbsp;will apply to degree requirements, you should contact a Program Counsellor as soon as you accept your offer of admission.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Waiting for a Decision</h2><p>Admission Committees for most programs review transfer applications and extend offers of admission on a continuing, rolling basis. Some programs, such as those with limited enrollment, only review applications after the published application deadlines.</p><p><strong>Already applied?</strong>Monitor the status of your application and required documents through your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/webadvisor/">WebAdvisor account</a>.</p><h3>Application Statuses</h3><ul><li><strong>Application Received:</strong>Your application has been received but isn’t complete quite yet.
