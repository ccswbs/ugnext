quotes:
  - As someone who did live off campus... being part of a club introduced me to that social campus life...Things about leading a team, things about working with your peers, taking a break from all the studying, being with these new found friends.
  - The experiential opportunities prepared me because these are also moments that you just can't find in a lecture hall anywhere. Being in a lab setting, helping out a professor...a researcher, seeing that lab work, being there, getting that experience, being in the anatomy lab with hands-on cadaveric based learning. These are all the things you learn by doing.
