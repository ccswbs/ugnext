quote: "The experiential opportunities prepared me because these are also moments that you just can't find in a lecture hall anywhere. Being in a lab setting, helping out a professor...a researcher, seeing that lab work, being there, getting that experience, being in the anatomy lab with hands-on cadaveric based learning. These are all the things you learn by doing."
