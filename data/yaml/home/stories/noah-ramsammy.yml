quotes:
  - I chose to come to the University of Guelph because there's so much that the Guelph community has to offer. The campus itself is beautiful. There's a lot of student supports accessing different services, and the clubs!
  - There are so many scholarships...for racialized individuals, scholarships that are grade based, scholarships for volunteer work. And when the University of Guelph does that, it really makes coming to post-secondary education more accessible for people like me.
  - The sweet potato black bean burger at Creelman is really good. I’m not a vegetarian, but for that burger I would be. It's nice to know that I can stay on campus, grab a nice bite to eat, sit with my friends a little bit, we can study together and then I can head on home.
