quotes:
  - What I found that the University of Guelph really pushed heavily on during my campus tour was the amount of emphasis they put on building a community. And they pushed it for a reason because I genuinely feel like this university has it.
  - I do a lot of work with the Lang School of Business and I'm in science. I shouldn't be, but I enjoy that kind of connection and I enjoy meeting and seeing all of these new people that I feel like I would not have gotten at any other university I chose.
  - I'd say the staff and faculty here have been really, really helpful for my development as a student, as a person, as a leader.
  - I feel like there's very few universities out there who put the focus on the students being the ones to improve life and give the students the power to change the way the world works.
