quotes:
  - We really emphasize collaboration, teamwork, and whether it's through my clubs or through just even my classes, that is one thing that I've learned and that really sets us apart from other schools.
  - U of G is providing students with the idea of using business as a force of good. And what we learn here is we are able to take it out in the world and provide those solutions.
  - I really wanted a university or program that kind of went above the basic theory for me and I knew that I wanted to go into some type of program that had a really good co-op program.
