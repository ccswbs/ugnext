    <p>Important things to remember:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Estimated cut-off ranges are based on the admission averages from previous
        years and are provided solely as a point of reference. Exact cut-offs for the
        current cycle will be determined by the quantity and quality of applications
        received and the number of places available in the program. Co-op averages
        will often exceed the estimated cut-off ranges. Students not admissible to
        co-op will be automatically considered for the regular program
      </li>
      <li>
        The University of Guelph will treat courses previously completed through Summer School, Night School, 
        or Correspondence in the same manner as those completed through day school. They will be considered equally in 
        determining your admission average. The University of Guelph will use the highest grade reported for any 
        repeated courses.
      </li>
      <li>The single asterisk * indicates that the program is offered with and without co-op.</li>
      <li>The double asterisk ** indicates that the program has a mandatory co-op.</li>
