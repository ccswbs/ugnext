admission_requirements: |
  <p>Completion of an honours (four-year) baccalaureate degree or equivalent in the social or applied human arts or sciences (e.g. family relations, sociology, psychology, social work), with a minimum 75% average in the last two years of study.</p>
  <p>Completion of a social science research methods course with a grade of 70% or higher.

admission_review_timeline: |
  <p>All information in your application package will be reviewed by the MPH Admissions Committee. Applications will be ranked using admissions criteria (academic background and performance, transcripts, statement of interest, referee assessments, and relevant experience). Annually, 25 applicants are offered admission. It is not expected that the program will increase in size from its current target of 25 full-time students, as this is central to the teaching delivery (didactic lecture integrated with discussion through case-based teaching and community-engaged learning). Successful domestic and international applicants will hear back mid to late April via WebAdvisor. If you do not receive communication about your application by that time, you can infer that you were not selected.</p>
